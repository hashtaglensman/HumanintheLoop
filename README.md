## Abstract

<!-- We believe that "human AND AI" is much more powerful than "human OR AI" ([some external evidence](https://www.theatlantic.com/sponsored/deloitte-consulting-2017/cognitive-collaboration-why-humans-and-computers-think-better-together/1196/)). 

The hil-se lab explores and provides machine learning solutions to assist humans in various software engineering tasks. These tasks include but are not limited to:
 - Retrieving relevant information.
 - Detecting and reducing ethical bias in human decisions.
 - Identifying certain software artifacts, e.g. security vulnerabilities, defects, tech debts, actionable static warnings.
 - Predicting for trace links between different software artifacts. -->

## Methods
We discussed two methods in the paper
### Method 1:
For this method, we defined the uncertain data as the test data which was misclassified with high confidence score. To order to capture the definition, we proposed the following,
The data is called to be uncertain when,
#### the feature of the test data is equvidistant from the feature space of the training data and,
#### the high ratio of the confidence score,

### Method 2:
If there is a disagreement between two scores obtained from the main classifier model, and the combination of different pruned and quantized models, then the data is considered as uncertain.

### Method 3:
